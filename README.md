# -JS_learning_project_workout_map

This is my JavaScript project for learning purposes.

I want to say that this is not my own product.
I don't create the disign.

I took completed by instructor files such as: index.html and style.css and others.

My practise is in the script.js file.

Here I learned and practiced some JS topics:

-Displaying a Map Using Leaflet Library
-Displaying a Map Marker
-How to use classes and inheritance
-Working with localStorage
